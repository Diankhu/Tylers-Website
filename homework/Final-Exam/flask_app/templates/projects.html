          <h2>Javascript Piano</h2>
          <p>
            This project was built purely in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. As for functionality,
            the project allows one to interact with a live minature piano that contains 10 white keys and 7 black keys.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can hover over the piano to see what keys on the keyboard correlate with the keys on the piano.
            When a piano key is played, the key itself will go down like a live piano key would and then go back to normal.
          </p>
          <p>
            I hope this helps you discover the power of music!

          <h2>Wordle Project</h2>
          <p>This project was built using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jinja, Flask, and SQL. As for functionality
             the project allows a user to play my imitation of the popular game of Wordle.
          </p>
          <p>
            The user will have to log into to access the game, but once logged in, will be prompted with an instruction screen
            and then allowed to play the game in which the user will have to guess at what the daily word is. The user can use one's native keyboard
            or the keyboard on the screen to input their guesses into a NxN grid that will be sized depending on the size of the daily word.
          </p>
          <p>
            I hope you enjoy my implementation of Wordle!
